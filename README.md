### About
A calendar designed as a tool to help you harness the concept of Memento Mori by visualizing your life week by week.

#
### How to use
Just select your date of birth and gender.
#
### What you will see
Based on your selected gender, the corresponding average life expectancy will be set.
A week is represented by a dot. A row represents a year (52 weeks).
The app calculates the weeks you already lived and shows them as a black dot.
The weeks that are left to be lived are shown as a light-grey dot.
The numbers on the right represent the corresponding year of the associated row.
